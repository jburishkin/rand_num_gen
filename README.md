- The program will continue to run until the user decides to quit by pressing 'q'.

## Requirements
- C++11 or later
- Standard C++ library

## How to Compile and Run
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang++).
2. Save the code to a file named `random_number_generator.cpp`.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
4. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ -o random_number_generator random_number_generator.cpp
